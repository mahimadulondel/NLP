    "\n",
    "The dictionary reports counts, proportion of total, average proportion per document, standard deviation of proportion per document, document count (i.e., number of documents containing at least one occurrence of the word), seven sentiment category identifiers,  number of syllables, and source for each word (source is either 12of12inf or the year in which the word was added).  \n",
    " \n",
    "The sentiment categories are: negative, positive, uncertainty, litigious, strong modal, weak modal, and constraining. The sentiment words are flagged with a number indicating the year in which they were added to the list. Note: A year preceded by a negative sign indicates the year/version when the word was removed from the sentiment category.  \n",

    "Although the dictionary does not, in general, include abbreviations, in the post-2018 versions we have added a limited number of abbreviations commonly occurring in the periodic filings"
